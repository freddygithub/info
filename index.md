## Letters from a Stoic scratch notes

### Letters II through LIV

These are some of my notes on what stood out to me and why.

I found an arching theme in these chapters playing with the idea of frienship. 
1. Friends are people you trust
2. Note the difference between the title 'friend' and the actually thing
3. Commit to friendship pg.35
  - "Welcome him and heart and soul"
  - Treat him as loyal, and you will make him such (Trust breeds trust)
  - Fear of being decieved, will teach other to decieve you
4. Difference between being friends and friendship
5. "There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with" (knowledge, pg.40)
6. We are easily influcenced by media, group think
7. Men learn as they teach
8. If you wish to be loved, love
9. Don't have friends becuase they care about/for you, we have friends to care for them. pg.49
10. "A person adopted as a friend for the sake of their usefulness will be cultivated only for so long as they are useful." pg.50
