## Letters from a Stoic scratch notes

### Letters II through LIV
Topics covered:
1. friendship
2. Influence 
3. Sacrifice

These are some of my notes on what stood out to me and why.
I found an arching theme in these chapters playing with the idea of frienship and mentorship. 

Friends: 
1. Friends are people you trust
2. Note the difference between the title 'friend' and the actually thing
3. Commit to friendship pg.35
  - "Welcome him and heart and soul"
  - "Regard him as loyal, and you will make him loyal" (Trust breeds trust)
  - Fear of being decieved, will teach other to decieve you
4. Difference between being friends and friendship
5. "There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with" (knowledge, pg.40)
6. We are easily influcenced by media, group think
7. Men learn as they teach
8. If you wish to be loved, love
9. Don't have friends becuase they care about/for you, we have friends to care for them. pg.49
10. "A person adopted as a friend for the sake of their usefulness will be cultivated only for so long as they are useful." pg.50

Sacrifice:
1. Compraing yourself to your other will always result in never being successful/happy, comparing yourself to your past you will have made progress 
  - "Here is another saying of Epicurus: „If you shape your life according to nature,
you will never be poor; if according to people‟s opinions, you will never be rich.‟ Nature‟s wants
are small, while those of opinion are limitless" pg.65
2. "all these things will only induce in you a craving for even bigger things"pg.65
3. Have clear ends to 'journeys' you take, if there is no end then it could be waste/hurt/trapping
  - "if after going a long way there is always something remaining farther away, be sure it
is not something natural.
